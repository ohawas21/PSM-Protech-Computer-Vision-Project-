\section{Project Goals}

The goal of this project is to support PSM-Protech in automating the extraction and interpretation of technical data from feasibility reports and scanned documents. The project aims to reduce manual work in data processing and accelerate feasibility analysis by implementing a hybrid pipeline composed of OCR and machine learning components.

This AI-driven solution will consist of:
\begin{itemize}
    \item An \textbf{OCR-based table extraction system} that automatically detects and parses numerical data from scanned documents or image-based PDFs.
    \item An \textbf{image classification module} that supports feasibility validation by recognizing key structural or visual patterns relevant to PSMâ€™s engineering decisions.
\end{itemize}

These capabilities will contribute to the automation of manual review processes in engineering and sales, reduce human error, and improve responsiveness during customer inquiries and project scoping.

\subsection*{Rich Picture: System in Context}

The following diagram illustrates the high-level interaction between actors (e.g., engineers, sales personnel), systems (e.g., OCR pipeline, document storage), and data flows. It serves to capture the context in which the AI solution will operate.

\noindent
In order to ensure that extracted geometric and dimensional values are aligned with industry expectations,
the system should interpret and validate numerical data in accordance with international standards such as
\textit{DIN EN ISO 1101}, which defines rules for geometrical tolerancing of form, orientation, location, and run-out.
