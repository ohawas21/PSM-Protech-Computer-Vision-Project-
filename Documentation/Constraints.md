# Project Constraints â€“ Feasibility Analysis of Blueprints

1. **Input Quality Constraints**
   - Blueprint variability in layout, resolution, or format.  
   - Presence of noise, smudges, or low contrast in scanned documents.  
   - Non-standard formats or annotations such as handwritten notes.

2. **Model Limitations**
   - YOLO may struggle with ambiguous edges or overlapping regions.  
   - OCR accuracy may drop for technical fonts or skewed/noisy images.

3. **Feasibility Rule Complexity**
   - Difficulty translating informal manufacturing rules into clear logic.  
   - Rules may evolve due to new technologies or changing tolerances.

4. **Annotation and Training Constraints**
   - Annotating training data for rectangles and text is time-consuming.  
   - Access to blueprints may be limited due to confidentiality concerns.

5. **Tooling and Technical Constraints**
   - High computational demand for training and inference.  
   - Need for compatibility with existing systems and file formats.

6. **User Constraints**
   - Certain decisions may still require manual verification.  
   - Users expect clear and interpretable results from the system.

7. **Time and Resource Constraints**
   - Limited project timeline to build and evaluate the system.  
   - Small team size or limited manpower may restrict model development.

8. **Evaluation Constraints**
   - Ambiguity in defining correct outputs in complex or unclear cases.  
   - Defining and achieving realistic performance benchmarks.
