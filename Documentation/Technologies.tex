    \textbf{Technology} & \textbf{Usage} \\
    \midrule
    Object Detection (YOLOv8)         & Precise detection of gear symbols and annotation regions within blueprint images. \\
    Classification Model              & Categorization of extracted symbols into predefined classes for downstream processing. \\
    Model Training                    & Implementation of optimized training pipelines leveraging GPU resources for faster convergence. \\
    Python \& OpenCV                  & Scripting and image pre-/post-processing tasks, including cropping and augmentations. \\
    PyTorch / Ultralytics             & Framework for defining, fine-tuning, and running deep-learning models for detection and classification. \\
    Docker \& Docker Compose          & Containerization of services and environment reproducibility across development and deployment. \\
    GitLab CI/CD                      & Automated build, testing, and deployment workflows for continuous integration and delivery. \\
    Data Preprocessing (pandas, NumPy)& Tabular data manipulation, feature extraction, and numerical operations on annotation metadata. \\
    Visualization (Matplotlib, Seaborn)& Plotting training metrics, data distributions, and performance insights. \\
    Roboflow                          & Image labeling, dataset versioning, and annotation management for both synthetic and real datasets. \\
