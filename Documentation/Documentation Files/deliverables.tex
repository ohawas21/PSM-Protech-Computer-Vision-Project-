\textbf{Target Description} & \textbf{Success Criteria} \
\midrule
Automate evaluation of mechanical drawings to reduce manual costs
& Blueprint evaluations proceed without manual intervention, reducing overall review workload. \
Extract part diagrams from blueprints via large-scale cropping
& The system reliably isolates and crops each part diagram from source blueprints for further processing. \
Identify critical tolerances and feasibility issues based on extracted data and predefined rules
& Tolerance data and feasibility concerns are accurately highlighted according to the established rule set. \
Classify extracted symbols from cropped regions into their respective classes
& Symbols detected within cropped regions are correctly assigned to their defined categories. \
Generate a comprehensive Excel sheet linking cropped drawings to their embedded information (symbols, values, tolerances)
& The output spreadsheet lists every cropped diagram paired with its corresponding extracted data fields.  \
